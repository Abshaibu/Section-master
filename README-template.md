## My process

I take a careful look at the challenge at hand, then I try to use my imagination to plan out the layout in my head and when I see that the layout is coming to live, I immediately get into writing the entire mark up with their different classes, id's, divs and/or sections. After that I head into the CSS and start with a mobile-first approach then I try to start styling in descending order.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Never underestimate basic CSS rules, make developer tools your best friend and above all  never give up on any project.
